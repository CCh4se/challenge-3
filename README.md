## Challenge - 3 

## Password Generator 

# Description 
For this project we were tasked with taking what we learned in class about javascript and apply that by creating a password generator. This was to be done by having prompts appear when clicking on the "Generate Password" button and selecting whether you would like to select certain fields. I was very close to getting the last bit of the code finshed, but I noticed I was doing more harm to my code that good.

My tutor Benicio Lopez helped a lot when it came to breaking down the challenge into pieces and understanding how to complete it one step at a time. I used www.w3schools.com and  www.developer.mozilla.org for understanding the pricinciples more and how they work together.
